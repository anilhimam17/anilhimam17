# 💫 About Me:
### Hi there, I'm Anil 👋<br>
I'm an **AI Engineer** with a singular focus: applying **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** to the world of Motorsports, especially **F1, WEC and MotoGP**. My passion is for building high-stakes, real-time systems where performance and accuracy are paramount. I build robust and efficient solutions, from low-level hardware interaction to large-scale AI/ML frameworks, to find the winning edge.<br>

### 🚀 My Core Focus<br>
**🔹 End-to-End Systems:** I have hands-on experience across the full ML pipeline, with a strong emphasis on `Generative AI, Computer Vision and Integrating LLMs with RAG`.<br>
**🔹 Mathematical Foundations** I have strong foundations in the Math behind modern AI algorithms to enable causally grounded inference.<br>
**🔹 Leadership & Collaboration:** I thrive in team environments, having led a team of 11 to develop a modular conversational AI system from the ground up.<br>

### 🏁 My Current Mission<br>
My primary goal is to contribute to the future of motorsports through technology. My current strategy involves:
<br>   **🔹 AI Racing Tools:** I am actively developing AI tools that can help setup cars, predict tyre degredation and provide strategy through a raceweekend by analysing historical data from the previous seasons.
<br>   **🔹 Focused Research:** Deep-diving into seminal AI research applicable to race strategy, vehicle dynamics, and real-time analytics.
<br>   **🔹 Foundational Excellence:** Continuously sharpening my skills in `Data Structures, Algorithms, and Mathematics`—the bedrock of any high-performance system.

Follow my journey as I build projects and share insights at the intersection of AI and elite motorsport.
